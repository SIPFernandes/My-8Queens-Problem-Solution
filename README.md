# My-8Queens-Problem-Solution
Given an input with the initial position of the 8 queens in a 8*8 board find a solution as fast as possible. While solving this problem, I simplified the backtracking algorithm and added permutations, so I solved the problem more quickly than it would be solved with the Linear Colision algorithm taught in the books.

Restrictions:
  -The initial intput cant have more then one queen per column.
