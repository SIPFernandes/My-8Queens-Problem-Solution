# My-8Queens-Problem-Solution
Given an input with the initial position of the 8 queens in a 8*8 board find a solution as fast as possible. While solving 8 queens problem, I simplified the backtracking algorithm and added permutations, so I solved the problem more quickly than through the Liear Colision algorithm taught in the books.
